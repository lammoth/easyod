## Requirements

To deploy Pub/Sub service you'll need Kafka. We are using following docker:

[kafka + zookeeper + Exhibitor Docker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sheeley/docker-kafka-exhibitor/)

## TODO list
- [ ] boot2docker docker config
- [ ] node.js client and server HelloWorld
- [ ] node.js kafka task queue
